During Gem Diamonds' half year 2017 results shareholders were notified that an offer to acquire 100% of the Ghaghoo asset had been received. Discussions have not resulted in agreement between parties and this offer has been withdrawn. Gem Diamonds is presently in discussions with other parties interested in acquiring 100% of the Ghaghoo asset and will update the market as and when appropriate. The board of Gem Diamonds decided to place the Ghaghoo mining operation on care and maintenance in February 2017, due to market conditions.   Full care and maintenance status was achieved in March 2017.   Feature image credit: Wikimedia
