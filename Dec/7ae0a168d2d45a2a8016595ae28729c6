ASX-listed Sovereign Metals has been granted additional ground directly along strike of its world-class Malingunde saprolite-hosted graphite deposit in Malawi.  The new 229 km² ground added is directly along strike to the south-east of the Malingunde deposit, extending the prospective strike length of the “Malingunde Trend” by ~25 km.  Previous exploration is known to have intersected saprolite-hosted graphite mineralisation in this newly granted area.  Following statutory relinquishments of non-prospective areas, the company’s total ground package is now 2 740 km². Sovereign’s first mover advantage means it is the dominant ground holder in the central Malawi graphite province, controlling ~80% of the total area prospective for flake graphite mineralisation.   Pre-feasibility (PFS) activities at Malingunde continue to rapidly advance, with 2017 resource drilling now completed and drilling of additional regional targets well advanced. “We are very pleased to have secured control of the entire Malingunde Graphite Trend, providing significant scale and optionality upside to the existing world-class resource that has been defined at Malingunde. Sovereign’s in-country team will commence targeted exploration along strike from Malingunde over the upcoming wet season (December – March) using the very cheap and effective hand-auger exploration tool,” says Sovereign Metals’ MD Dr Julian Stephens.
