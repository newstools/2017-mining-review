Resource Generation (ResGen) has signed an agreement with Noble Resources International to supply additional uncontracted coal to be produced from its Boikarabelo mine. The deal was concluded through ResGen's subsidiary, Ledjadja Coal (LCL). It follows an agreement earlier this year to re-state the existing domestic off-take and marketing agreements ResGen has with Noble and its related bodies corporate, and grant Noble a first right of refusal to purchase any additional uncontracted coal to be produced from the mine. The key terms of the uncontracted tonnage off-take agreement, LCL has agreed to offer to sell and deliver to Noble for years one to three, a committed quantity of 800 000 tpa, plus up to 300 000 tpa as advised by LCL to Noble on a quarterly basis. From year four onwards, LCL will offer to sell and deliver to Noble up to 200 000 tpa as advised by LCL to Noble on a quarterly basis. LCL's obligation to sell and deliver the coal under the uncontracted tonnage off-take agreement is subject to LCL having sufficient contracted rail and port capacity to deliver the tonnages (taking account of LCL's existing commitments). Performance of the uncontracted tonnage offtake agreement is subject to receipt of relevant regulatory/shareholder approvals. The company intends to consult with ASX regarding what shareholder approvals (if any) it may require and will update the market in due course.
