Tancoal Energy has recorded a record for coal production for the month of November 2017 of 59,061 tonnes compared to 36,079 tonnes in November 2016. Intra Energy Corporation (IEC) has made significant progress with its Eastern African regional expansion strategy into new mining and renewable energy projects and battery storage materials, and maintains cost effective and efficient operations to remain a low cost producer in this dynamically growing region where it occupies the prime supply position. IEC announced that its flagship coal project Tancoal mine in the Ngaka coalfield of Tanzania operated by Tancoal Energy (a joint venture with the National Development Corporation of Tanzania) has made record production in November 2017. Year to date (YTD), production is 240,851 compared to 140,679 in the prior year. A stockpile of 40,824 tonnes has been produced to manage surplus demand during the rainy season which has commenced. This is in line with government requirements for surplus stock to avoid any disruption to industrial supply. Sales were 40,885 tonnes compared to 35,370 in November 2016. YTD sales are 210,636 compared to 132,575 in the prior year. Sales were lower than October due to customers finding it difficult to hire trucks to pick up the coal but this is expected to only be a temporary shortage. The increase in prices that has taken effect over the previous few months and the improvement in mining efficiency resulted in a small profit in October 2017. Talks have been held with the Mtwara Port authorities in Southern Tanzania to enable the preparations for coal to be exported from the port. Discussions are now being held with transport companies to optimise the efficiency of haulage to the port. "It is pleasing to note the ability of the mine to produce at a rate of more than 700 000 tonnes per year although availability of trucks is of concern," comments IEC chairman Graeme Robertson. "It is important that trucks be allowed to haul trailers to attain higher payloads for coal and cement to enable competitive road haulage for regional and export trade. "This is critical to Tanzania for development," he concludes. Feature image credit: Wikimedia
